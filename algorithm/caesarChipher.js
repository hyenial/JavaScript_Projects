/*
In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, 
Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. 
It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. 
For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. 
The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.
The encryption step performed by a Caesar cipher is often incorporated as part of more complex schemes,
such as the Vigen√®re cipher, 
and still has modern application in the ROT13 system.
As with all single-alphabet substitution ciphers, 
the Caesar cipher is easily broken and in modern practice offers essentially no communications security.
